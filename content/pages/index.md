# The IPFS Project

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and
identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications.
It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.

IPFS is an open source project developed by the [IPFS Community](http://ipfs.io) and many contributors
from the open source community.

## How it works

IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed
file system that seeks to connect all computing devices
with the same system of files. In some ways, IPFS
is similar to the Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single
BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git
repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput
content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed
hyperlinks. This forms a generalized Merkle
DAG, a data structure upon which one can build versioned
file systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web. IPFS
combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange,
and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single
point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.
