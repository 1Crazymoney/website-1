        <h5>HTTP is inefficient and expensive</h5>
        <p>HTTP downloads a file from a single computer at a time, instead of getting pieces from multiple computers simultaneously.</p>

        <h5>Humanity's history is deleted daily</h5>
        <p>Remember GeoCities? The web doesn't anymore. :( It's not good enough for the primary medium of our era to be so fragile.</p>

        <p>It's too easy for powerful forces and reactive politics to undermine the webâ€”against the common interests of humanity.</p>

        <h5>The developing world needs reliable networks</h5>
        <p>The need for more local networks is real. Many regions don't have access to broadband, let alone reliable network infrastructure.</p>
