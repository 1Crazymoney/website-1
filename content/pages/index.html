        <h5>HTTP is inefficient and expensive</h5>
        <p>HTTP downloads a file from a single computer at a time, instead of getting pieces from multiple computers simultaneously. <a href="http://math.oregonstate.edu/~kovchegy/web/papers/p2p-vdn.pdf">With video delivery, a P2P approach could save 60% in bandwidth costs.</a></p>

        <h5>Archivists</h5>
        <p>It's not enough to organize the world's information—we need to store it in a way the world can remember it. IPFS provides deduplication, high performance, and clustered persistence.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-flex-cell">
        <h5>Service providers</h5>
        <p>If your company delivers large amounts of data to users, a peer-to-peer approach could save you millions in bandwidth. IPFS can provide secure peer-to-peer content delivery.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-flex-cell">
        <h5>Researchers with data</h5>
        <p>If you're working with, distributing, and analyzing huge datasets, IPFS offers fast performance and decentralized archiving.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="grid-flex-container">
      <div class="grid-flex-cell">
        <h5>Developing world</h5>
        <p>High latency networks are a high barrier of entry to developing world. IPFS networks can provide resilient access to data and persistence offline.</p>

        <h5>Content creators</h5>
        <p>IPFS brings the freedom and independent spirit of the web at full force—and at low cost. For users in freedom-hostile states or dealing with sensitive data, IPFS is a good fit.</p>
