        <h5>HTTP is inefficient and expensive</h5>
        <p>HTTP downloads a file from a single computer at a time, instead of getting pieces from multiple computers simultaneously. <a href="http://math.oregonstate.edu/~kovchegy/web/papers/p2p-vdn.pdf">With video delivery, a P2P approach could save 60% in bandwidth costs.</a></p>
        <p>IPFS makes it possible to distribute high volumes of data with high efficiency. And zero duplication means savings in storage.</p>

        </div>
        <h5>Humanity's history is deleted daily</h5>
        <p><a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2011/11/the-average-lifespan-of-a-webpage/">The average lifespan of a web page is 100 days.</a> Remember GeoCities? The web doesn't anymore. It's not good enough for the primary medium of our era to be so fragile.</p>
        <p>IPFS provides historic versioning (like git) and makes it simple to set up resilient networks for mirroring of data.</p>

        </div>
        <h5>The web's centralization limits opportunity</h5>
        <p>The Internet has been one of the great equalizers in human history and a real accelerator of innovation. But the increasing consolidation of control is a threat to that.</p>
        <p>IPFS remains true to the original vision of the open and flat web, but delivers the technology which makes that vision a reality.</p>

        <h5>Our apps are addicted to the backbone</h5>
        <p>Developing world. Offline. Natural disasters. Intermittent connections. All trivial compared to interplanetary networking. The networks we're using are so 20th Century. We can do better.</p>
        <p>IPFS powers the creation of diversely resilient networks which enable persistent availability with or without Internet backbone connectivity.</p>

      <h2>How IPFS works</h2>
      <h5>Let's take a look at what happens when you add files to IPFS:</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="how-item grid-flex-container">
      <div class="illustration grid-flex-cell">
          <img src="/theme/images/ipfs-illustrations-how-1.svg" />
      </div>
      <div class="how-description grid-flex-cell">
        <h5>Each folder, the files inside it, and all of the blocks within each file are given a unique index called a hash.</h5>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="how-item grid-flex-container">
      <div class="illustration grid-flex-cell">
          <img src="/theme/images/ipfs-illustrations-how-2.svg" />
      </div>
      <div class="how-description grid-flex-cell">
        <h5>Because every block and every file in IPFS has a unique hash, we're able to remove duplications across the network and track a version history for every file.</h5>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="how-item grid-flex-container">
      <div class="illustration grid-flex-cell">
          <img src="/theme/images/ipfs-illustrations-how-3.svg" />
      </div>
      <div class="how-description grid-flex-cell">
        <h5>On the network, each node is aware of each of its neighbors, and has a list of the location of the hashes they know about.</h5>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="how-item grid-flex-container">
      <div class="illustration grid-flex-cell">
          <img src="/theme/images/ipfs-illustrations-how-4.svg" />
      </div>
      <div class="how-description grid-flex-cell">
        <h5>When you're looking up a file or a folder, you look it up by its hash. If a node doesn't know about a hash, it asks the network to find nodes that store the content behind the hash.</h5>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="how-item grid-flex-container">

        <h5>To make things easy for people, everything can be found by human-readable names, using a decentralized naming system called IPNS.</h5>

    <h2>IPFS is useful here and now</h2>
    <div class="illustration">
      <img src="/theme/images/ipfs-illustration-uses-network.svg" />

        </div>
        <h5>Archivists</h5>
        <p>It's not enough to organize the world's information—we need to store it in a way the world can remember it. IPFS provides deduplication, high performance, and clustered persistence.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-flex-cell service-providers">
        <div class="illustration">
          <img src="/theme/images/ipfs-illustration-service.svg" />
        </div>
        <h5>Service providers</h5>
        <p>If your company delivers large amounts of data to users, a peer-to-peer approach could save you millions in bandwidth. IPFS can provide secure peer-to-peer content delivery.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-flex-cell">
        <div class="illustration">
          <img src="/theme/images/ipfs-illustration-data.svg" />
        </div>
        <h5>Researchers</h5>
        <p>If you're working with, distributing, and analyzing huge datasets, IPFS offers fast performance and decentralized archiving.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

        </div>
        <h5>Developing world</h5>
        <p>High latency networks are a real barrier of entry to developing world. IPFS provides resilient access to data, independent of low latency or connectivity to the backbone.</p>

        <h5>Content creators</h5>
        <p>IPFS brings the freedom and independent spirit of the web at full force—and at low cost. IPFS can help deliver content in a way which can save you considerable money in bandwidth.</p>
