<p class="lead">
IPFS is the collective work of thousands of contributors from multiple geographies and backgrounds, working <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt#how-we-work-together">collaboratively and asynchronously</a> to decentralize the Web.
</p>

We organize ourselves into focused teams called Working Groups. Each group defines its own roadmap, objectives and priorities. You can find more information about this group structure in the [team management repo](https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/blob/master/TEAMS_ROLES_STRUCTURES.md#working-groups).

The IPFS Working Groups are:

- [**Project Operations**](#project-operations)
- [**Testing Infra**](#testing-infra)
- [**IPFS as a Service**](#ipfs-as-a-service)
- [**Package Managers**](#package-managers)
- [**Docs and Developer UX**](#docs-and-developer-ux)


There are also Special Interest Groups, pushing forward research and development on:

- [**Integration with Web Browsers**](#integration-with-web-browsers)
- [**IPFS GUI**](#ipfs-gui)
<!-- - [**IPFS Cluster**](#ipfs-cluster) -->
- [**Local Offline Collaboration**](#local-offline-collaboration-locol)

<!-- - [**Dynamic Data and Capabilities**](#dynamic-data-and-capabilities)
- [**Decentralized Data Stewardship**](#decentralized-data-stewardship) -->
