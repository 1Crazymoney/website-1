# ipfs.io website

This is a metalsmith template based website. generate it with:

```
npm install
make
```

The output is in `build/`.

Note: if you change layouts, you'll need to run `make` again as the watcher fails to watch them :/

## TODO

- make this easy to publish with ipfs.
- make this easy to publish with ipns + dns.
